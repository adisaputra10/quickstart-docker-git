# quickstart-docker-git

Sometimes getting to a good docker based setup for your new project is a
little too inconvenient.

This repository aims to maintain a collection of up-to-date quickstart base
repos that will help you bootstrap your shiny new docker project.

Some examples:
- Static file service based on [nginx](https://github.com/hasura/quickstart-docker-git/tree/master/nginx)
- Web service in Swift ([Vapor](https://github.com/hasura/quickstart-docker-git/tree/master/swift-vapor), [Perfect](https://github.com/hasura/quickstart-docker-git/tree/master/swift-perfect))
- Deploying a [MySQL](https://github.com/hasura/quickstart-docker-git/tree/master/mysql) service
- [Wordpress](https://github.com/hasura/quickstart-docker-git/tree/master/wordpress)
- A simple [php-apache](https://github.com/hasura/quickstart-docker-git/tree/master/php-apache) quickstart

# What is included

Folders in this repo represent base repos for web frameworks, CMSs or databases.

- Use ``docker build`` to build your own image
- Initialise a git repo, and run ``git push`` to push to github that can be
  integrated with a docker hub's automated builds
- Use ``docker run`` and get a running container. Basic configuration options
  are specified in docker-config.yaml.

# What is NOT included

This is just a collection of quickstart repos. The idea is to modify the
quickstart template as you need to get to a basic setup that works. Hence,
this doesn't include things like setting up docker-compose files or more
advanced framework specific configurations yet.

# Repo Structure

Every base repo has the following structure:

```
/
--Dockerfile
--docker-config.yaml
--README.md
--app/
```

The README inside the base repo will contain further instructions.

# How to use a base repo from this collection

To use any base-repo, do the following:

- Clone this repo:
  ``git clone https://github.com/hasura/quickstart-docker-git``

- Copy the relevant base-repo:
  ``mv quickstart-docker-git/nodejs-express my-node-project``
  ![git clone example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/quickstart-docker-git/master/_docs/1-git-clone.png)

- Initialize your own git repo inside this folder if you want:
  ``cd my-node-project && git init``

- Build and run your own docker image:
  ``docker build -t my-node-app .``

- Test if this app is working by making a request to the container, at '/'.

# `git push` your code as a service on the cloud

If you have gotten the base-repo of your choice to work on your machine, you may want to deploy your code as an API/service to the cloud. Using [Hasura](https://hasura.io), you can do that with a simple `git push` command. Follow these instructions to get started:

- Get yourself a free Hasura project by signing up at the [Project Dashboard](https://dashboard.hasura.io)
- Check out the reference documentation on [how to create a `git push` service and deploy your code as a service](https://docs.hasura.io/0.14/ref/custom-microservices/creating-git-push-microservices.html)

# Automated Docker hub builds

All base repos in this collection can readily be integrated to setup an
automated docker image build system.

# Contribution needed!

Please fork, file comments/bugs and submit your PRs!  We've created a list of
issues where active help is required:
[help-wanted](https://github.com/hasura/quickstart-docker-git/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted).

Specifically,

1. Add support for more frameworks
2. Optimise ``Dockerfile``s for faster builds, or for production (esp. for compiled languages)

Some important things to keep in mind when contributing:

1. Expose only one port, and one data volume to help keep things simple
2. Annotate the ``Dockerfile`` with comments where you expect users to modify
3. Try to document the following major use cases when writing your README: ``docker build``, ``git push`` based automated docker build, ``docker run``
